//"index.js" is a common file name used in JavaScript projects for the main entry point of a module or application
//It is a convention that has been adopted by many JavaScript libraries and frameworks, including Node.js.
//This module defines a simple route for the home page that renders a view using Handlebars. 
//When a client navigates to the home page, the view engine will render the "index" template and send the resulting HTML to the client.

//create a new router object and assign it to the "router" constant
//The Router() method is used to create a modular, mountable set of routes that can be used in an Express application.
//It allows you to separate your routes into separate files, making your code easier to maintain and test.
const router = require("express").Router();
const Cart = require('../models/cart');
const Product = require('../models/product');
const Order = require('../models/order');

//call the "router" object get() method to define a route for the home page "/"
//The request handler function takes three arguments: req, res, and next. req contains information about the incoming request, res is the response object, and next is a function that can be called to pass control to the next middleware function in the chain.  The response handler function calls the res.render() method, which renders the index view and sends the HTML to the client.
router.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  res.render("index");
});

module.exports = router;
